### Earchquake Mapping

## Project Overview

In this project, I will develop an interactive map that uses GeoJSON data to show earthquake events around the world. The map includes layers of  earchquake related data including their location, magnitute, and tectonic plates lines, visualized on three different views (streets, satellite, and dark).

## Resources
**Data Source:** Earthquakes GeoJSON, Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON, Tectonic Plate GeoJSON
**Software:** JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Visual Studio Code 1.73.1, Leaflet 1.9.3, D3.js 7.6.1

## Results
